Abstract:
Emotion detection in textual data is a crucial component of effective marketing strategies, with social networking sites (SNS) providing a rich source of consumer sentiment data. However, deciphering the emotion from these texts, often marked by vernacular expressions and abbreviations, poses significant challenges. This study introduces a novel approach to enhance emotion detection by converting SNS informal texts into everyday language using ChatGPT, a generative large language model. The study uses ten publicly available emotion datasets and a unique tweet dataset, converting an equal number of converted texts through ChatGPT. Three models were trained for comparison: one using original texts (n=408,359), another with converted texts (n=408,359), and the last with a combination of both (n=816,718). The models trained with the combined dataset outperformed those trained solely on original texts, indicating that converting SNS vernacular into everyday language improves emotion detection. The study provides significant insights for enhancing emotion analysis in human-robot interaction and other fields reliant on accurate emotion detection, demonstrating the potential of large language models in NLP data augmentation.
